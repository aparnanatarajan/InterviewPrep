 * Given a set of n nuts of different sizes and n bolts of different sizes. There is a one-one mapping between nuts
 * and bolts. Match nuts and bolts efficiently.
 * Constraint: Comparison of a nut to another nut or a bolt to another bolt is not allowed. It means nut can only be
 * compared with bolt and bolt can only be compared with nut to see which one is bigger/smaller.
 *
 * Nuts represented as array of character
 * char nuts[] = {‘@’, ‘#’, ‘$’, ‘%’, ‘^’, ‘&’}
 * Bolts represented as array of character
 * char bolts[] = {‘$’, ‘%’, ‘&’, ‘^’, ‘@’, ‘#’}
